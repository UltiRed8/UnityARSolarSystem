# Unity AR Solar System 🌌

__A project made as an exercise from Objectif3D to learn AR in Unity.__

The goal was to make a game where the user could place the solar system in AR around them.

The player could then get information about each planet in the solar system by clicking on them, and change the rotation speed of the solar system with a slider.
